Description: Proteins reside in either the cell plasma of in the
    cell membrane. A membrane protein goes through the 
    membrane at least once. There are multiple ways to span this 
    hydrophobic layer. One common structure is the transmembrane (alpha)
    helix (TMH). Given the amino acid sequence of a membrane protein, this
    package predicts which parts of the protein are TMHs.
