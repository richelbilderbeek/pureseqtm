\usage{
create_pureseqtm_files(
  fasta_filename,
  folder_name = get_default_pureseqtm_folder(),
  temp_folder_name = tempfile(pattern = "pureseqt_")
)
}
\arguments{
\item{fasta_filename}{path to a FASTA file}

\item{folder_name}{superfolder of PureseqTM.
The superfolder's name is \code{/home/[user_name]/.local/share}
by default, as can be obtained by
\link{get_default_pureseqtm_folder}}

\item{temp_folder_name}{path of a temporary folder.
The folder does not need to exist.
Files that are out in this folder are not automatically
deleted, which is not a problem, as the default
path given by \link{tempdir} is automatically cleaned
by the operating system}
}
\value{
full path to the files created
}
